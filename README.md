# gnact
Geospatial Network Analysis with Clustering and Time (GNACT) is a Python package to explore and analyze dense, geospatial datasets.

The package includes the following main modules:
- gnact.clust
 This module contains functions to apply a range of clustering methods against a Pandas DataFrame with a lat, lon, time, and id for each position.  The results can be summarized as clusters (calc_centers) and key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score can be calculated (calc_stats).  Key helper functions like calc_nn (which returns a df with the distance to the nearest site for each point) and get_df_stats (which returns a df determining if a cluster is a True Positive, False Positive, or False Negative) integrate with other GNACT functions.
 
 - gnact.plotting
 This module builds on clustering functions to plot clusters, stops, and statistical summaries using Folium.
 
 - gnact.network
 This module generates static trip segmentation based on a list of sites to generate a df of ordered stops.  This df can then be treated as an edgelist and is used as such by functions to plot specific UIDs and analyze the network generated by these edgelists.
 
 - gnact.route_pred
 Given an ordered list of stops from the network module, this module can use an NLP N-Gram based extension to predict the next site visited (N+1) given the historical probability of known previous site visits.
 
 - gnact.utils
 This module includes connections to a PostGres Database, several helper functions for managing databases, and an traj_enhance_df function that addes speed and course over ground to a DataFrame that includes lat, lon, and time.
 
 Additional work is ongoing to develop a time_series module to include in GNACT.
